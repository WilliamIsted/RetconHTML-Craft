# Retcon HTML v. 1.0.3

## Got WYSIWYG?

Ever have a client put 4 MB PNG files in their Redactor fields, failing to apply any of your meticulously crafted image transforms? Writers consistently using the `<strong>` tag for headers? Have you ever needed to implement lazy loading of images embedded in WYSIWYG content, or wanted to remove pesky inline styles without breaking a sweat? This is for you.

**Retcon HTML** is a small [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com) plugin offering a series of easy-to-use Twig filters for manipulating HTML content.

## Installation and setup

* Download & unzip
* Move the /retconhtml folder to craft/plugins
* Install from Control Panel

***

## Basic usage

_Please see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/mmikkel/RetconHTML-Craft/wiki) for documentation, featureset overview and code examples._

_Retcon HTML_ uses [DOMDocument](http://php.net/manual/en/class.domdocument.php) to rewrite HTML. It includes a series of different methods, exposed as Twig filters:

```twig
{{ entry.body | retconTransform( 'someImageTransform' ) }}
```

All methods, however, can also be called as template methods:

```twig
{{ craft.retconHtml.transform( entry.body, 'someImageTransform' ) }}
```

...or through the Retcon HTML service, if you ever want to use it in your PHP:

```php
<?php echo craft()->retconHtml->transform( $entry->body, 'someImageTransform' ); ?>
```

If you prefer, Retcon also includes a "catch-all" filter, taking the filter name as its first argument:

```twig
{{ entry.body | retcon( 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ) }}
```
```twig
{{ craft.retconHtml.retcon( entry.body, 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ) }}
```
```php
<?php echo craft()->retconHtml->retcon( $entry->body, 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ); ?>
```

And finally, you'll also be able to apply several operations in one go (for a _theoretical_ performance gain). Each index in the operation array will be either a String value (filter name) if there are no arguments, or an array of arguments (where the filter name should be the first index).

```twig
{{ entry.body | retcon( [
    [ 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ],
    'lazy',
    [ 'attr', '.foo', { 'class' : 'bar' } ]
] ) }}
```
```twig
{{ craft.retconHtml.retcon( entry.body, [
    [ 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ],
    'lazy',
    [ 'attr', '.foo', { 'class' : 'bar' } ]
] ) }}
```
```php
<?php
echo craft()->retconHtml->retcon( $entry->body, array(
    array( 'transform', 'someImageTransform' ),
    'lazy',
    array( 'attr', '.foo', array( 'class' => 'bar' ) ),
) );
?>
````

### Methods

### Settings

#### Base transform path
By default, Retcon HTML will store any transformed images to a subfolder below the original image (identical to Craft's behaviour when applying transforms to an AssetFileModel). If you want to store transforms somewhere else, you can set a different base path here. Make sure that the folder is writable!

#### Base transform URL
Self explanatory.

#### Encoding
HTML output will be encoded to **UTF-8** by default, but you can set the encoding to be anything you want.
